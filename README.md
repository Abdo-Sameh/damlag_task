# damlag_task

* My solution is faster because i used extra memory for saving the current max element for any node in the Stack.
* Same for mean, I used a cumulative variable which accumulate integers in the stack for every position.

The order of max function is O(1) and the same for mean function.
Also i have measured the time for both functions.
